biomarkers,string,General terms/acronyms,"biomarker is “a biological molecule found in blood, other body fluids, or tissues that is a sign of a normal or abnormal process, or of a condition or disease,”(NCI) such as cancer. Biomarkers typically differentiate an affected patient from a person without the disease. The alterations can be due to a number of factors, including germline or somatic mutations, transcriptional changes, and post‐translational modifications. There is tremendous variety of biomarkers, which can include proteins (e.g., an enzyme or receptor), nucleic acids (e.g., a microRNA or other non‐coding RNA), antibodies, and peptides, among other categories. A biomarker can also be a collection of alterations, such as gene expression, proteomic, and metabolomic signatures. Biomarkers can be detected in the circulation (whole blood, serum, or plasma) or excretions or secretions (stool, urine, sputum, or nipple discharge), and thus easily assessed non‐invasively and serially, or can be tissue‐derived, and require either biopsy or special imaging for evaluation. Genetic biomarkers can be inherited, and detected as sequence variations in germ line DNA isolated from whole blood, sputum, or buccal cells, or can be somatic, and identified as mutations in DNA derived from tumor tissue.",,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,
